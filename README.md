ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

Tool Used: Scikit-learn Dataset: Iris Flower Dataset

What I Did: Loaded and explored the Iris dataset to understand the distribution of features across species. Applied preprocessing techniques including label encoding and feature scaling. Trained classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression and Decision Tree) to predict the iris species. Evaluated models using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. Outcome: Achieved high classification accuracy, successfully predicting flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions.
